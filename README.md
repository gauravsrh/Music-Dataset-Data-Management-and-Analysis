# Music-Dataset-Data-Management-and-Analysis

The primary goal of this project was to explore and analyze a comprehensive music dataset, leveraging various data management and analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights.

# Project Overview

Our project focused on understanding the relationships between different musical attributes and their impact on track popularity. We also aimed to identify lively tracks suitable for event playlists. The project was divided into several key stages:

    Dataset Selection and Exploration:
        Initially selected a dataset with 7 columns and 100,000 rows.
        After re-evaluation, finalized a music dataset with 17 columns and 17,000 rows containing diverse information about songs, artists, and various features.

    Data Uncleaning and Cleaning:
        Introduced artificial noise to the dataset to create unclean data scenarios.
        Employed Tableau Prep for data cleaning, addressing missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.

    User Stories and Data Profiling:
        Developed user stories to guide our analysis, focusing on the correlation between track attributes and popularity, and identifying lively tracks for events.
        Conducted data profiling and visualization using Tableau and Python.

    Analysis and Visualization:
        Explored and visualized correlations between various musical attributes and track popularity.
        Implemented filters and visual tools to aid in dynamic data exploration and decision-making.

# Tools and Technologies

    Tableau Prep: Used for data cleaning and profiling.
    Python: Utilized for additional data analysis and visualization.
    Libraries: Included Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
